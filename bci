II/ Brain Control Interfaces - Different Approaches
- invasive - implants electrodes directly in your brain
- non-invasive - BCIs that sense your brain waves by electrodes on the scalp

How BCIs listen to the signals from your brain (via your scalp):
- Frequency Analysis 
	- nearly everyone produces alpha waves when they close their eyes
	- look at more frequency bands at different or multiple locations on the scalp
	- people cannot control the frequency content of the signals in their head. 
	- how to control your mental state such as "alertness", "relaxation", "focus", etc.  
	- It requires much practice and, has yielded unreliable results.  
	- But, it is easy to implement on the computer.
- Mu Wave (Mu Rhythms) Detection
	- Mu waves are special because they occur in the combined sensorimotor cortex 
	- If the electrodes are in the right place, Mu waves show up when the body is relaxed.
	- When muscles contract the Mu waves in that part of the brain get suppressed (Sensory Homunculus)
	- the EEG setup is a little harder, but one's ability to actually control these brain waves is much better.

	- the only electrodes needed to capture Mu Wave the ones over the motor cortex.   
- Event-Related Potentials (ERPs)
	- ERPs are EEG measurements of a particular sensory stimulus, which then causes a response in the brain.  
	- Often visual stimuli are used via a computer screen.  
	- if user is paying attention to the visual stimuli, EEG shows one type of response. 
	- if user ignores the stimuli, EEG show a different response.  
	- User can interact with the computer through focusing (or not) on the visual stimuli.

- EEG Frequency Bands
  https://neuro-style.com/eeg-signal-classification-for-brain-computer-interface-applications
  - BETA 
  	- between 13 and 30 Hz, 
	- has a low voltage between 5-30 µV. 
	- is associated with active thinking, active attention, focus on the outside world or solving concrete problems. 
	- can reach frequencies near 50 hertz during intense mental activity. 

  - ALPHA
  	- between 8 and 13 Hz, with 30-50 µV amplitude. 
	- indicate both a relaxed awareness and also inattention. 
	- strongest over the occipital (back of the head) cortex and also over frontal cortex. 
	- is the most prominent wave in the whole realm of brain activity.
	- a peak in the beta range as high as 20 Hz, which has the characteristics of an alpha state rather than a beta.
	- Alpha alone seems to indicate an empty mind rather than a relaxed one, a mindless state rather than a passive one, 
	- can be reduced or eliminated by opening the eyes, by hearing unfamiliar sounds, or by anxiety or mental concentration.
	- There are several sources of activity in the Alpha range.  
	- The most common trigger for Alpha waves is simply to close your eyes.  
	- In most people, closing your eyes idles the visual cortex (the whole back portion of your brain...the "occipital" region), which causes Alpha waves to appear throughout the rear portion of the brain.  This called the Posterior Dominant Rhythm.  The Mu Waves, by contrast, are associated with the sensorimotor portion of your brain, so they should only appear in the signals from the electrodes over that part of the brain.

  - THETA
  	- lie within the range of 4 to 7 Hz, with an amplitude usually greater than 20 µ V. 
	- Theta arises from emotional stress, especially frustration or disappointment. 
	- Theta has been also associated with access to unconscious material, creative inspiration and deep meditation. 
	- The large dominant peak of the theta waves is around 7 Hz.
  - DELTA
  	- Delta waves lie within the range of 0.5 to 4 Hz, with variable amplitude. 
	- Delta waves are primarily associated with deep sleep, and in the waking state, were thought to indicate physical defects in the brain. 
	- It is very easy to confuse artifact signals caused by the large muscles of the neck and jaw with the genuine delta responses. 
	- because the muscles are near the surface of the skin and produce large signals whereas the signal which is of interest originates deep in the brain and is severely attenuated in passing through the skull. 
	- Nevertheless, with an instant analysis EEG, it is easy to see when the response is caused by excessive movement. 
  - GAMMA
  	- Gamma waves lie within the range of 35Hz and up. 
	- this band reflects the mechanism of consciousness - the binding together of distinct modular brain functions into coherent percepts capable of behaving in a re-entrant fashion (feeding back on themselves over time to create a sense of stream-of-consciousness). 
  - MU
  	- It is an 8-12 Hz spontaneous EEG wave associated with motor activities and maximally recorded over motor cortex. 
	- They diminish with movement or the intention to move. 
	- Mu wave is in the same frequency band as in the alpha wave, but this last one is recorded over occipital cortex. 
	- Mu Waves appear naturally when your body is physically relaxed.  
	- The appearance of the Mu Waves are an indication that the sensorimotor portion of your brain is "idling".  
	- When you move a major body part, those portions of your brain stop "idling", and the Mu Waves are "suppressed" during the motor activity.  
	- Amazingly, this portion of your brain exhibits the same Mu Wave suppression simply by imagining the motion of a body part.  Even better, the specific portion of your cortex where the Mu Waves are suppressed is linked to the body part that you're imagining moving.  Now that's cool!
	- The different regions of the sensorimotor cortex, *roughly* correspond to different body parts.  
	- Feet and legs are near the top of the head.  Hands are near the middle.  
	- Face and tongue are near the bottom of the cortex, which on your scalp is located just above your ears.
	- The Mu rhythm occurs in the frequency range commonly referred to as Alpha waves (8-12 Hz).  
	- if you hook up an EEG sensor system to your scalp, and if you put some electrodes exactly over the sensorimotor portion of your brain, you should be able to see Mu Waves when you relax your body.  
	- read the tutorial from BCI2000 to get a better idea of where to put electrodes and which electrodes to use for reference and bias.

	- the presence or absence of Mu Waves is pretty easy to see
	- If you imagine moving just your feet, the Mu waves are only suppressed in a small portion of your sensorimotor cortex that, for the feet, is near the top of your head.  
	- Imagining moving your hands suppresses the Mu waves in a different part of the cortex (down closer to the ears).  So, with more electrodes -- electrodes that are carefully placed over the different regions of the sensorimotor cortex -- we should be able to distinguish between thoughts of moving your hands versus moving your feet.
