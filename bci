I/ EEG - a brief overview

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography
- history of EEG
- different EEG frequency bands

EEG Setup:

http://www.bci2000.org/wiki/index.php/User_Tutorial:EEG_Measurement_Setup
- aspects of EEG
- electrode placement, typical EEG artifacts...especially of eye motion
- undesirable signals that get picked up by the EEG system

Typical EEG Signals:

http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1139332-overview#aw2aab6b3
- "Alpha waves", "Beta waves", "Theta waves", and such

http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1139332-overview#aw2aab6b3
- shape of the waves ("morphology" of the waves)
- "Sleep Spindles" and "K Complexes"

- Alpha waves

II/ Brain Control Interfaces - Different Approaches
- invasive - implants electrodes directly in your brain
- non-invasive - BCIs that sense your brain waves by electrodes on the scalp


How BCIs listen to the signals from your brain (via your scalp):
- Frequency Analysis 
	- nearly everyone produces alpha waves when they close their eyes
	- look at more frequency bands at different or multiple locations on the scalp
	- people cannot control the frequency content of the signals in their head. 
	- how to control your mental state such as "alertness", "relaxation", "focus", etc.  
	- It requires much practice and, has yielded unreliable results.  
	- But, it is easy to implement on the computer.
- Mu Wave (Mu Rhythms) Detection
	- Mu waves are special because they occur in the combined sensorimotor cortex 
	- If the electrodes are in the right place, Mu waves show up when the body is relaxed.
	- When muscles contract the Mu waves in that part of the brain get suppressed (Sensory Homunculus)
	- the EEG setup is a little harder, but one's ability to actually control these brain waves is much better.

	- the only electrodes needed to capture Mu Wave the ones over the motor cortex.   
- Event-Related Potentials (ERPs)
	- ERPs are EEG measurements of a particular sensory stimulus, which then causes a response in the brain.  
	- Often visual stimuli are used via a computer screen.  
	- if user is paying attention to the visual stimuli, EEG shows one type of response. 
	- if user ignores the stimuli, EEG show a different response.  
	- User can interact with the computer through focusing (or not) on the visual stimuli.
